#land-boards I2C-TEMP-01 Card Code

These are the files needed to use the I2C=TEMP-01 card with the Arduino.

[The Wiki page for this card is here.](http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=I2C=TEMP-01)

##Ownership

Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others. There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there". Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same. Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

In particular, we have a copy of the Adafruit library for the MC23008. It's a version that we know works with our card, but there may be more recent copy on the [Adafruit site](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MCP23008-library).

##Warning

Use at your own risk. If you brick your part or it melts to a puddle, it's on you not me. Really!
