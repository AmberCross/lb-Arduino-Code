== LCD Display Examples using Adafruit style I2C Backpack ==

* The Adafruit style backpack can be distinguished from the other I2C displays by the five pin (I2C/SPI) connector.
* Another complication is that the pinout doesn't match standard Sensor Shields.

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of them were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
