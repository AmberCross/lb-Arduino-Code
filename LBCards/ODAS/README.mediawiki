* These are Land Boards' [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Open_Data_Acquisition_System_.28ODAS.29 Open Data Acquisition cards related] Arduino Code.
* Individual card details are in their own GitHub folders or under the library folder
* There are two Testers in these folders.
* The [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/ODAS/ODASTESTER first tester] runs on an Arduino Nano mounted to a [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=NANO-BKOUT NANO-BKOUT] card with [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=I2C-RPT I2C-RPT] card
* The [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/ODAS/ODASTESTERv2 second tester] requires the same cards plus a [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO32-I2C DIGIO32-I2C] card

=== Program Function ===

* Menu driven
* 
* Uses the Configuration EEPROM contents to auto-detects card (if EEPROM has already been programmed)
* Allows EEPROM to be written using card types
* Use to run Loopback Tests
* Use to run Bouncing LEDs

=== Files ===

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
