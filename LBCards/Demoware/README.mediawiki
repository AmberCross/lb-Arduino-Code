* These are the Land Boards Show Demos files.

== Demo Files ==

* LBLED7Segment
* NeoPixels

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
